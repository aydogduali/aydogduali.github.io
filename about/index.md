I hold a PhD in physical oceanography from the Ca’ Foscari University of Venice and
Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change (CMCC; Bologna) on data assimilation (DA) in regional
and coastal scales. I studied variational and ensemble DA techniques as well as observation network
design methodologies (OSE/OSSE). I had my post-doc at Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center
(NERSC; Bergen) on ensemble-based data assimilation techniques using adaptive moving mesh models
with applications on Arctic sea-ice. I visited NCAR within the visitor programme of CISL before
starting my current position as a research scientist at CMCC where I coordinate data assimilation
activities in regional and coastal scales including Mediterannean and Black Sea MFSs involved in
CMEMS MFCs. I took part in several European projects including SESAME, MyOcean and JERICO as
well as DASIM and REDDA in collaboration with US. I am a member of the OceanPredict data
assimilation task team (DA-TT). I teach at the Università di Bologna in data assimilation.
