## FESOM/DART interface is out!

During my PhD, I worked on high-resolution modelling and data assimilation in the Turkish Straits System using a finite element ocean model (FESOM) and an ensemble data assimilation

*This movie shows the error reduction in the salinity RMS of differences at the
first 50 m after assimilation (bottom) of synthetic ferrybox observations
compared to assimilation-free simulation (top) between Jan 1, 2009 and Jan 8,
2009*
